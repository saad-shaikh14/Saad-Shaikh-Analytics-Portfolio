											<h2>About my Visualising Techniques in Detail</h2>
											<h3>A technique to use the facts to tell a beautiful story from the data</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
                                            I have experience in visualizing data using a variety of software and programming
                                            languages such as Python, R, and Tableau. I have been able to assimilate, 
                                            aggregate, and query financial data to provide recommendations based on statistical 
                                            analysis.
                                        </p>
                                        </p>                                       
                                            One of my key strengths is creating multiple dashboards to showcase year-on-year 
                                            analysis of different products and services. This has helped me to gain a deeper 
                                            understanding of the data and identify trends and patterns that would have been 
                                            difficult to spot otherwise. In addition, I have used multiple visualization methods
                                            like funnel and map visuals to study current organizational and management strategies,
                                            and compare the feasibility and potential impacts of proposed alternatives.
                                        </p>
                                        </p>
                                            In my experience, Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn have been invaluable 
                                            tools for data visualization. They are easy to use and provide a wide range of options 
                                            for creating visually appealing plots and charts. Furthermore, I have used Tableau for 
                                            creating interactive dashboards and reports that can be easily shared with stakeholders.
                                        </p>
                                        </p>
                                            Another tool that I have experience with is Power BI, which is a business intelligence 
                                            tool that allows you to connect to various data sources and create interactive dashboards 
                                            and reports. It is a great tool for data analysis and visualization, and it is also very 
                                            user-friendly.
                                        </p>
