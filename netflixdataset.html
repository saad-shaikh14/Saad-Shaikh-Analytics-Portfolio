                                            In summary, analyzing the Netflix movies/TV dataset using pandas and matplotlib in Google Colab has allowed us 
                                            to explore the entertainment industry in a hands-on way. By filtering and manipulating the data, we were able 
                                            to uncover some interesting insights about movie duration and genre. This project not only sharpened our data 
                                            manipulation skills but also gave us an opportunity to brush up on our Python skills. Overall, it was a great 
                                            learning experience that demonstrated the power of data analysis in uncovering trends and patterns in real-world data.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            In addition to the above, we continued our analysis by plotting the data using matplotlib.pyplot. We created scatter 
                                            plots and bar graphs to visualize the distribution of movie durations and the popularity of different genres over time.
                                            This allowed us to see trends in the data that would have been difficult to spot just by looking at the raw numbers.
                                            We found that, over time, the average duration of movies has declined, and that certain genres, such as Action and 
                                            Adventure, have become more popular.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            We also discovered that some of the short films were documentaries or animated films. This was an unexpected finding, 
                                            as we initially thought that these shorter films might have been low-budget or less popular. However, after further 
                                            analysis, we realized that these shorter films were in high demand, as they offered a different type of content that 
                                            people were interested in.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            In conclusion, this project was a great opportunity to apply our data manipulation and Python skills to real-world data. 
                                            By using the pandas library and matplotlib.pyplot, we were able to uncover insights about the entertainment industry and 
                                            the trends in movie duration and genre popularity. This project has helped us understand the power of data analysis in 
                                            gaining valuable insights from data and has provided us with a strong foundation for future data analysis projects.<br>
