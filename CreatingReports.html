											<h2>Creating Informative Reports</h2>
											<h3>A language to communicate data information to non-technical stakeholders</h3>

                                            I have experience in creating reports for all business strategies including sales,
                                            marketing, business growth, and finances. By utilizing data analysis and 
                                            visualization techniques, I was able to increase sales by 75%.
                                        </p>
                                        </p>                                        
                                            One of the key ways I contributed to this success was by implementing surveys and 
                                            questionnaires as a feedback system. This helped me to gather valuable insights 
                                            from customers and use that information to improve the services offered by the company.
                                        </p>
                                        </p>
                                            In addition to creating reports, I also had the opportunity to analyze implemented 
                                            marketing measures and submit a recommendation report to the managing director. 
                                            This report included my findings and recommendations on how to optimize marketing 
                                            efforts and drive more sales.
                                        </p>
                                        </p>
                                            I also have experience in preparing reports on findings, illustrating data graphically 
                                            and translating complex findings into written text for the marketing management team. 
                                            This helped to ensure that the team was able to understand and act on the insights gained 
                                            from the data.
                                        </p>
                                        </p>
                                            Furthermore, I have provided support in creating dashboards using visualization tools like 
                                            Power BI, RapidMiner, and Tableau. These tools allow me to present data in an interactive 
                                            and user-friendly way, making it easier for stakeholders to understand and act on the insights 
                                            gained from the data.
                                        </p>
