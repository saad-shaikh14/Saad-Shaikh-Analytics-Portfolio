                                            Collecting ultrasound images for breast cancer is an important step in the process of detecting and classifying 
                                            the disease. Ultrasound images are often used in the medical field as they are non-invasive and can provide a 
                                            clear picture of breast tissue. This information is then used to diagnose and monitor breast cancer.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            Once the images have been collected, deep learning algorithms such as MobileNetV2 and InceptionV3 have been applied 
                                            to them. These algorithms use artificial neural networks to analyze the images and identify any potentially cancerous 
                                            growths. The results from these algorithms are then compared and evaluated to determine the best approach for detecting
                                            and classifying breast cancer.

                                            <br>
                                            The study emphasizes the importance of collecting ultrasound images for breast cancer diagnosis and monitoring. 
                                            The use of non-invasive ultrasound imaging provides clear pictures of breast tissue, which are then analyzed using 
                                            deep learning algorithms such as MobileNetV2 and InceptionV3. The results from these algorithms are compared and 
                                            evaluated to determine the best approach for detecting and classifying breast cancer.

                                            <br>
                                            In addition to deep learning techniques, The study also investigated the key events that contribute to breast cancer, 
                                            including family history, age, and other risk factors. This information was used to develop models that could filter 
                                            images based on the type of breast cancer, allowing doctors and researchers to focus on specific types for improved 
                                            diagnosis and treatment.

                                            <br>
                                            The results showed that deep learning-based techniques are highly effective for breast cancer detection, with the highest 
                                            accuracy of 83.84% achieved using InceptionV3. The use of transfer learning greatly reduced the amount of data and 
                                            computational resources required to train the model, leading to this high accuracy.

                                            <br>
                                            Furthermore, The study highlights the importance of developing models that can filter images based on the type of breast 
                                            cancer. This will make diagnosing and treating the disease easier and contribute towards reducing the impact of breast 
                                            cancer on people's lives. With these deep learning techniques, we can take a big step towards improving breast cancer 
                                            detection and treatment.

                                            In conclusion, The study demonstrates the significance of collecting ultrasound images for breast cancer and the 
                                            effectiveness of deep learning algorithms in detecting and classifying the disease. The results of our study provide 
                                            valuable insights into the future of breast cancer detection and treatment, and highlight the importance of developing
                                            models that can filter images based on the type of breast cancer.
