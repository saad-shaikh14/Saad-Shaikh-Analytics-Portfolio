											<h2>About Analysing Datasets</h2>
											<h3>A generic Technique every Data/Business Analyst should know</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											Data is a key factor in today's corporate climate for making decisions and generating
											effective solutions. I have a broad range of expertise in this field, including 
											familiarity with machine learning methods as well as programmes like Python, R, and
											Microsoft Excel.
										</p>
										<p>
											My strongest suit is the ability to use Python, R, and Microsoft Excel proficiently. 
											Python and R are robust programming languages frequently used for manipulating and 
											analysing data. They provide a variety of libraries that make it simple to clean, 
											process, and analyse datasets, like pandas and Numpy.I am familiar with these libraries
											and is capable of manipulating datasets with them. On the other hand, I have has 
											experience utilising Microsoft Excel, a frequently used application for data analysis 
											and manipulation, along with Vlookup and macros.
										</p>
										<p>
											Have knowledge of the aforementioned as well as Visual Studio Code, a code editor 
											that supports a number of programming languages. It contains a number of features 
											that make it an effective tool for manipulating data, including debugging, an 
											integrated terminal, and version control. I am proficient in writing, running, and 
											debugging Visual Studio Code code to manipulate datasets successfully.
										</p>
										<p>
											I am also familiar with machine learning algorithms. A kind of artificial intelligence
											called "machine learning" enables computers to learn from data and form inferences or 
											judgements without having to be explicitly programmed. Data categorization, grouping, 
											and prediction are just a few of its many uses in data analysis and manipulation. possess 
											a working understanding of some of these methods and are able to manipulate datasets and 
											make predictions using them.<br>
											<br>
											My familiarity with the ETL process is another crucial component of my skill set. Data movement
											from one system to another, often from a source system to a data warehouse, is accomplished through 
											the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process. Data Mapping, Integration, Migration, and Transformation 
											are all steps in the process that I am familiar with. The ability to properly transfer data from one 
											system to another and to comprehend how data moves inside an organisation are made possible by this 
											knowledge, which is crucial.<br>
											<br>
											I can leverage all of these abilities to lead to productive business solutions. I can identify 
											insights and trends that may be used to improve business decisions thanks to my experience and 
											understanding in studying and modifying datasets. My appropriate training and expertise are also 
											key assets in a fast-growing company.
