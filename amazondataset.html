                                            The analysis of Amazon movie/TV datasets reveals some interesting trends in the film industry over time.
                                            The release year vs movie runtime chart shows that as time passes, more data is present in the chart, 
                                            which may reflect the growing demand and popularity of the filming and cinematic industry. Additionally, 
                                            the dispersion of runtimes is broadening, indicating that mainstream movie lengths are becoming more flexible.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            The release year vs genres count trend-line shows that 'Drama' has been the most popular genre for movies for
                                            nearly six decades. However, there was a surge in 'Western' genre movies in the late 1930s, but that quickly 
                                            sank back down in the 1940s. Due to the many different types of genres present in the dataset, it is difficult 
                                            to distinguish other trends.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            The correlation matrix plot shows the relationship between production countries, age certification, and IMDB 
                                            score of all the movies in the dataset. The IMDB score of movies has no relationship with both the production 
                                            countries and age certification. However, there is a slight relation between the moviesâ€™ production countries 
                                            and age certification, which may be due to local regulations present from each respective country.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            The majority of the films are released between the late 20th century up to the present year. Most of these 
                                            movies are PG-13 age certified, have more than 100 minutes of runtime, and are mostly produced in the 
                                            United States. The dataset also consists of a wide variety of genres, but drama is notably the most common genre.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            To address the issue of bias skews in the data, the movies data was filtered to only include IMDB votes of more 
                                            than 1000. This results in a second table with no significant differences in conclusions from the release year, 
                                            runtime, genres, and production countries columns. However, there are fewer PG-13 rated movies and the highest 
                                            IMDB score is 8.8, which is lower than the first table. This shows that the bias skews in the data have been 
                                            successfully removed.<br>
                                            <br>
